```

**🧩 Explanation**

* It’s a *continuous loop*, similar to DevOps (CI/CD), but tailored for ML models.
* Each stage can be automated through **pipelines**, managed in platforms like **Kubeflow**, **Vertex AI**, or **MLflow**.

    D5[Monitoring (Prometheus, Grafana)]
    end

    M2[Model Training (TensorFlow, PyTorch)]
    M3[Pipelines (Kubeflow, MLflow, Airflow)]

    M5[Monitoring (Prometheus + Model Drift Tools)]
    end

    D4 --> M3
    M2 --> M3 --> M4
    M4 --> M5
```

**🧠 Key Takeaway**

> In DevOps, you combine many individual tools.
> In MLOps, a **single platform (like Kubeflow)** integrates all these tools — pipelines, serving, monitoring — on top of Kubernetes.

## 🧩 **Diagram 3: Kubeflow Architecture (Simplified)**

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Kubeflow Platform
    A1[🎓 Notebook Server] --> A2[🧬 Pipeline Components]
    A2 --> A3[📦 Training Jobs (TFJob, PyTorchJob)]
    A3 --> A4[🚀 Model Serving (KServe)]
    A4 --> A5[📈 Monitoring & Feedback]
    end

    subgraph Underlying Infra
    B1[(Kubernetes Cluster)]
    B2[(Docker Containers)]
    B3[(Storage: GCS, S3, PVC)]
    end

    A1 & A2 & A3 & A4 & A5 --> B1
    B1 --> B2
    B1 --> B3
```

**✨ Highlights:**

* Each **step** (data prep → training → deploy → monitor) runs as a **containerized component**.
* Kubeflow uses **Kubernetes** as the engine and **Docker** as the packaging format.
* It’s **scalable, reproducible, and automatable**.

    style C3 fill:#ffe082,stroke:#f57c00,stroke-width:2px
```

**🧠 Explanation:**

* Developers write **Python-based pipeline scripts** using the **Kubeflow DSL**.
* These are compiled into **YAML manifests**, which Kubeflow uses to orchestrate containers.
* Each component (step) is **independent, reusable, and scalable**.

    participant Dev as 👩‍💻 Data Scientist
    participant KF as ☁️ Kubeflow Platform
    participant K8s as ⚙️ Kubernetes Cluster
    participant API as 🌍 Deployed Model API
    participant User as 👨‍💼 End User

    Dev->>KF: Push pipeline.py
    KF->>K8s: Deploy training containers
    K8s->>KF: Return trained model artifact
    KF->>K8s: Deploy model with KServe
    User->>API: Send prediction request
    API-->>User: Return prediction result
    KF-->>Dev: Send metrics & drift reports
```

**🚀 Flow Summary**

1. You push a pipeline (`.py` + `.yaml`) into Kubeflow.
2. Kubeflow deploys components to Kubernetes.
3. Model trains, gets deployed, and serves via an API.
4. Feedback loops keep improving the model.
