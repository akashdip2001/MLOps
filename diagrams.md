## 🧠 Diagram 1: End-to-End MLOps Lifecycle Overview

    A[📥 Data Collection] --> B[🧹 Data Preprocessing / Feature Engineering]
    B --> C[🧠 Model Training]
    C --> D[🔍 Model Evaluation]
    D --> E[🚀 Model Deployment]
    E --> F[📊 Monitoring & Feedback]
    F --> A

    subgraph "Continuous Improvement"
    A --> B --> C --> D --> E --> F --> A
    end
```

### 🧩 Explanation

* It’s a **continuous loop**, similar to DevOps (CI/CD), but tailored for ML models.
* Each stage can be automated through **pipelines**, managed in platforms like **Kubeflow**, **Vertex AI**, or **MLflow**.

## ⚙️ Diagram 2: MLOps Tools & Platforms Comparison

```mermaid
graph LR
    subgraph DevOps
    D1[Source Control - GitHub, GitLab]
    D2[CI/CD - Jenkins, GitHub Actions]
    D3[Containerization - Docker]
    D4[Orchestration - Kubernetes]
    D5[Monitoring - Prometheus, Grafana]
    end

    subgraph MLOps_Platform[MLOps Platform]
    M1[Data Ops - Dataflow, Spark, Pandas]
    M2[Model Training - TensorFlow, PyTorch]
    M3[Pipelines - Kubeflow, MLflow, Airflow]
    M4[Model Serving - KServe, TensorFlow Serving]
    M5[Monitoring - Prometheus + Model Drift Tools]
    end

    D4 --> M3
    M2 --> M3 --> M4
    M4 --> M5
```

### 🧠 Key Takeaway

> In DevOps, you combine many individual tools.
> In MLOps, a single platform (like **Kubeflow**) integrates all these tools — pipelines, serving, monitoring — on top of Kubernetes.

## 🧩 Diagram 3: Kubeflow Architecture (Simplified)

```mermaid
graph TB
    subgraph Kubeflow_Platform[Kubeflow Platform]
    A1[🎓 Notebook Server] --> A2[🧬 Pipeline Components]
    A2 --> A3[📦 Training Jobs - TFJob, PyTorchJob]
    A3 --> A4[🚀 Model Serving - KServe]
    A4 --> A5[📈 Monitoring & Feedback]
    end

    subgraph Underlying_Infrastructure[Underlying Infrastructure]
    B1[(Kubernetes Cluster)]
    B2[(Docker Containers)]
    B3[(Storage: GCS, S3, PVC)]
    end

    A1 & A2 & A3 & A4 & A5 --> B1
    B1 --> B2
    B1 --> B3
```

### ✨ Highlights

* Each step (data prep → training → deploy → monitor) runs as a **containerized component**.
* Kubeflow uses **Kubernetes** as the engine and **Docker** as the packaging format.
* It’s **scalable, reproducible, and automatable**.

## 🔄 Diagram 4: Kubeflow Pipeline Flow

```mermaid
flowchart TD
    subgraph Pipeline
    P1[🧩 Component 1: Data Preprocessing]
    P2[🏋️ Component 2: Model Training]
    P3[📊 Component 3: Evaluation]
    P4[🚀 Component 4: Deployment]
    end

    P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4

    subgraph Kubeflow_DSL[Kubeflow DSL]
    C1["Python Script (.py)"] --> C2["Compile with DSL Compiler"]
    C2 --> C3["Pipeline YAML (.yaml)"]
    end

    C3 --> Pipeline
```

### 🧠 Explanation

* Developers write **Python-based pipeline scripts** using the **Kubeflow DSL**.
* These are compiled into **YAML manifests**, which Kubeflow uses to orchestrate containers.
* Each component (step) is **independent, reusable, and scalable**.

## 🧱 Diagram 5: Real-World Deployment Flow (Example)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Dev as 👩‍💻 Data Scientist
    participant KF as ☁️ Kubeflow Platform
    participant K8s as ⚙️ Kubernetes Cluster
    participant API as 🌍 Deployed Model API
    participant User as 👨‍💼 End User

    Dev->>KF: Push pipeline.py
    KF->>K8s: Deploy training containers
    K8s->>KF: Return trained model artifact
    KF->>K8s: Deploy model with KServe
    User->>API: Send prediction request
    API-->>User: Return prediction result
    KF-->>Dev: Send metrics & drift reports
```

### 🚀 Flow Summary

1. You push a pipeline (`.py` + `.yaml`) into Kubeflow.
2. Kubeflow deploys components to Kubernetes.
3. Model trains, gets deployed, and serves via an API.
4. Feedback loops keep improving the model.

Would you like me to now generate a **README.md** version that includes these diagrams, short explanations, and placeholders for your own screenshots (so it looks like a real portfolio project)?
